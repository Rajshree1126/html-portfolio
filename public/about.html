<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate student and software developer with a strong foundation in C, Java, and data structures. My technical expertise spans app and game development, Git, and I hold impressive NPTEL certifications in programming. I also have experience with Unity, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m diving into Tailwind CSS to refine my design skills further.</p>
<p> On the creative side, I love painting and share my artistic journey on Instagram through my account, ArtPup, aiming to inspire 10,000 followers by the end of 2025. Additionally, I’m exploring YouTube with funny and engaging art challenge videos, blending humor and creativity. Fluent in multiple languages, including Marathi, Hindi, English, and with basic knowledge of German and Korean, I’m versatile and driven in both technical and artistic pursuits.</p>
